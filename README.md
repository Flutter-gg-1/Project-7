# Tuwaiq Gallery App

## Overview

### Features
- User Registration and Login: Secure sign-up and login process using OTP.
- Project Management: Users can manage projects and view details of each project.
- Barcode Scanning: Scan and generate barcodes using `flutter_barcode_scanner` and `barcode_widget`.
- File Management: Upload and pick files such as PDFs or images using `image_picker` and `file_picker`.
- Webview Support: Open web content using `flutter_webview_plugin` and `webview_flutter`.
- Interactive UI Components: Includes features like rating bars, countdown timers, and expansion tiles.

### User Authentication
The app uses secure authentication methods, including OTP (One Time Password) through the `pinput` package, to ensure user verification. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely.



## DataLayer

The `DataLayer` class is responsible for managing user authentication and data retrieval in the Project Judge application. It utilizes the `GetStorage` package for local storage and interacts with an API to fetch user and project information.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Saves and retrieves authentication information using `AuthModel`.
- **User Profile Management**: Loads user profile data from the API and stores it locally.
- **Project Information Retrieval**: Fetches project details from the API.

### Dependencies

- `get_storage`: A lightweight storage solution for Flutter applications.
- `project_judge/models/auth_model.dart`: Contains the `AuthModel` for user authentication.
- `project_judge/models/user_model.dart`: Contains the `UserModel` for user profile representation.
- `project_judge/network/api_network.dart`: Contains methods for making API calls.

### Class Members

- `ApiNetowrok api`: An instance of the `ApiNetowrok` class to handle network requests.
- `AuthModel? authUser`: Stores the authenticated user's information.
- `UserModel? userInfo`: Stores the user's profile information.
- `List<Projects>? projectInfo`: Stores information about various projects.
- `final box = GetStorage()`: Instance of `GetStorage` for local data management.

### Constructor

- `DataLayer()`: Initializes the data layer and loads any existing data from storage.

### Methods

- `saveUserAuth({required AuthModel auth})`: Saves the authentication information locally.
- `Future<void> getUserr()`: Asynchronously retrieves the user's profile from the API and stores it locally.
- `Future<void> getProjectInfo()`: Asynchronously retrieves project details from the API.
- `loadData()`: Loads stored authentication and user information from local storage.




### API Network Integration

The app implements a centralized `ApiNetwork` class that provides various network-related functionalities, consolidating multiple API methods under one unified interface. The `ApiNetwork` class is built by extending the `ConstantNetwork` and leveraging several mixins, each responsible for specific tasks. This modular approach ensures clean and maintainable code when interacting with the backend.

#### Features:

- **CreateAccountMethod**: Handles user registration and account creation.
- **VerifyAccountMethod**: Provides functionality for verifying user accounts.
- **LoginAccountMethod**: Manages user login, including authentication and session handling.
- **UpdateProfileMethod**: Enables users to update their profile information.
- **UpdateProjectMethods**: Allows users to modify details related to their projects.
- **ProjectDetails**: Retrieves detailed information about specific projects.
- **CreateProjectMethod**: Facilitates the creation of new projects through the API.
- **RatingProjectMethod**: Submits and retrieves project ratings.

The `ApiNetwork` class integrates all these methods to simplify API calls throughout the app, making it easier to handle operations like account management, project creation, and ratings submission.


By using `ApiNetwork`, the app can communicate efficiently with the backend, reducing the complexity of managing multiple API endpoints while keeping the codebase clean and scalable.


### Constant Network Configuration

The app uses a `ConstantNetwork` class to manage all the API base URLs and endpoints. This class centralizes API configuration, ensuring that endpoints are easy to maintain and reference throughout the project.

#### Key Features:

- **Base URL**:  
  All API requests are made through the base URL:  
  `https://tuwaiq-gallery.onrender.com/v1`
  
- **Endpoints**:  
  The following key API endpoints are defined within the `ConstantNetwork` class:
  - **User Authentication:**
    - `createAccountEndPoint`: `/auth/create/new/account`
    - `loginAccountEndPoint`: `/auth/login`
    - `verifyAccountEndPoint`: `/auth/verify`
    - `resendOTPEndPoint`: `/auth/resend`
  - **User Profile:**
    - `getProfileEndPoint`: `/user/profile`
  - **Project Management:**
    - `updateProjectLogoEndPoint`: `/user/edit/project/logo`
    - `updateProjectBaseEndPoint`: `/user/edit/project/base`
    - `updateProjectImagesEndPoint`: `/user/edit/project/images`
    - `updateProjectPresentationEndPoint`: `/user/edit/project/presentation`
    - `updateProjectLinksEndPoint`: `/user/edit/project/link`
    - `updateProjectMembersEndPoint`: `/user/edit/project/members`
    - `getFirstHundredProjectsEndPoint`: `/projects`
  - **Project Rating:**
    - `ratingProjectEndPoint`: `/user/rating/project`
  - **Supervisor Role:**
    - `supervisorCreate`: `/supervisor/create/project`


By having all endpoints clearly defined in this class, the app can ensure consistent and centralized API management, making it easier to update or expand the network interactions.


## Navigation Page

The app features a **Navigation Page** that allows users to switch between different sections of the app, such as Home, Browse, My Projects, and Profile. A floating middle button is included, which initiates a **QR code scanner** to enable users to quickly navigate to specific project rating pages by scanning a project QR code.

### Features:

- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: A user-friendly bottom navigation bar lets users easily switch between:
  1. **Home Screen**
  2. **Browse Page**
  3. **QR Code Scanner** (Middle Button)
  4. **My Projects**
  5. **Profile Screen**
  
- **QR Code Scanner**: 
  - Integrated with the `flutter_barcode_scanner` package, users can scan a QR code to quickly navigate to the **Rating Page** for a project.
  - If the scan is successful, it retrieves the project ID and redirects the user to the **Rating Page** with the corresponding project details.
  
- **Real-Time Navigation**: 
  - Selected navigation index is maintained through the app, ensuring the user returns to the correct section.
  - The QR scanner launches from the middle button and handles scan failures gracefully with error handling.

### Rating Page

The app includes a comprehensive project rating page where users can evaluate various aspects of a project on a scale from 1 to 10. The rating categories include:

- **Idea**
- **Design**
- **Tools**
- **Practices**
- **Presentation**
- **Investment**

Each category is represented with a slider and an accompanying icon for better visual clarity. Users can also add any additional comments or feedback in the **Notes** section.  

### Features:

- **Rating Submission**: Users can submit their ratings by tapping the submit button.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: A loading animation is displayed during the submission process, and potential errors are handled with appropriate dialogs.
- **Bloc Pattern**: The page uses the Bloc pattern for state management, ensuring smooth interaction and separation of concerns.

## App Structure
The project is divided into multiple layers to promote clean architecture:

- Components: Reusable widgets such as buttons, navigation bars, and custom UI elements.
- Data Layer: Manages network requests and handles data storage (local and remote).
- Models: Contains data models used across the app.
- Screens: Contains all UI screens like `LoginScreen`, `ProjectDetailScreen`, and `BarcodeScreen`.
- Services: Manages background services like local storage and networking.
